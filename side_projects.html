      <h1 id="about">About Me</h1></br></br>

      <p>Senior Data/Software Engineer at the National Renewable Energy Lab. Working on solar and wind resource assessment for renewable energy technology deployment.</p>

      <p>I received a Physics Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2019. My <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/70060">thesis</a> was titled "Analysis of Low-Frequency Climate Variability Through Computational Modeling and Tree-Ring Data Synthesis." My research interests mostly lie at the intersection of climate science and machine learning. This also includes computational fluid dynamics, physics based modeling and computer graphics, flight simulation, and robotics. </p>

      <p>I graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2012, where I received a Physics B.S., Magna cum Laude, completed the University Honors Program and participated in a number of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EyBB7bYAAAAJ&hl=en">research projects</a>. My honors <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.84.043648">thesis</a> was titled "Prototyping method for Bragg-type atom interferometers." I received an M.S. in Physics from Cornell in 2016. My Masters <a href="docs/telequad.pdf">thesis</a> was titled "VR Quadcopter Telepresence Proposal". </p>

      <h1 id="teaching">Teaching Experience</h1></br></br>

        <p>I worked as a T.A. nearly every semester during my time at Cornell, in addition to participating in teaching activities as an undergraduate. While at Cornell my duties included conducting office hours, grading, designing homework and exam questions, running small group lectures, and lab demonstrations.</p>

        <b>Computer Graphics:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Topics here included digital images, filtering and antialiasing, 2-D and 3-D affine geometry, ray tracing, perspective and 3-D viewing, the graphics pipeline, curves and surfaces, and human visual perception.</li>
	<li>As a graduate student T.A. for this large class I led projects on manipulators and animation.</li>
	<li>This required corresponding website documentation, assignment construction, updating the Java code framework, and handling online student questions.</li>
	</ul>

	</br><b>Numerical Analysis:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>This course covered the fundamentals of numerical linear algebra: direct and iterative methods for linear systems, eigenvalue problems, singular value decomposition.</li>
	<li>These methods were used to build iterative methods for nonlinear systems and for multivariate optimization.</li>
	<li>As the only T.A. I held extensive office hours on all topics, graded projects, and helped both design questions and document solutions.</li>
	</ul>

	</br><b>Introductory Physics:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>As a two course series, the first course topics included kinematics, forces and dynamics, momentum, energy, fluid mechanics, waves and sound, thermal physics, kinetic theory, and thermodynamics.</li>
	<li>The second course covered electricity, magnetism, ray optics, wave optics, quantum mechanics, and nuclear physics.</li>
	<li>The auto-tutorial version of this sequence included extensive one-on-one tutoring and lab demonstrations, while the standard sequence required running lab sessions and grading experiment exercises.
	</li>
    </ul>

        </br><b>Drawing:</b>
	</br>On occasion I go on a drawing spree, which has been an on-again off-again hobby of mine since my elementary school days. Feel free to check out the results of my latest <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drchessgremlin/">creative surge</a>.

        </br></br><b>Chess:</b>
	</br>I love to play chess in my spare time and regularly frequent Twitch chess streams, Chess.com, and Chessable.com. Feel free to shoot me a <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/chessgremlin/">challenge</a>.

        </br></br><b>Electronics:</b>
	</br>I am also an avid DIYer, especially when it comes to electronics. This interest has been ongoing since childhood, having decided at 10 years old that forgetting my password was a good excuse to take apart my laptop. Though, only recently have I acquired the knowledge to put such a device back together again. Recent projects include building my own desktop computer, configuring a spare CPU and motherboard as a home router, and a few quadcopter. These quadcopter builds inspired further work in this area, leading the way to my M.S. project.

	</br></br><b>Coding:</b>
	</br>I recently worked on a chat bot for Twitch. This bot uses machine learning to classify chat messages into non-offensive and offensive categories to moderate chat in real-time. It is trained on past chat data, uses a linear SVM for classification, and tf-idf for feature vectorization. If you are interested in this project shoot me an email.
